#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds Soonbar from source and installs it in place of any installed copy.
# For Macs where downloaded apps are blocked (e.g. managed by an organization), or to run unreleased code.
#
# Usage: scripts/update-from-source.sh          # latest release tag (tested code)
#        scripts/update-from-source.sh --main   # tip of main (unreleased changes)
#
# Needs the Command Line Tools (xcode-select --install). Your settings are kept.
# Source builds don't auto-update; run this again to update.
# Self-cleaning: it builds in a temporary checkout that is deleted when the script ends — on success,
# failure or Ctrl-C — so nothing is left in the repo or on disk except the installed app.
# Optional env:
#   SIGN_IDENTITY  code-signing certificate name; keeps Calendar/Reminders access across rebuilds
#                  (otherwise macOS asks again after each rebuild — see README)
#   INSTALL_DIR    where to install (default ~/Applications, no admin rights needed)
#   NO_LAUNCH=1    don't open the app afterwards
